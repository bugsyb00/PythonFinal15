 Overview:

This project is a Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling 
(SPIDAM) whose goal is to create a virtual environment that allows for the
analysis and graphing of a sound that is input into the program. The
program inteds to be user friendly with the addition of a simple GUI allowing
the user to upload a sound file. After the input is aquired
the program will clean the audio and display a total of 6 graphs that 
show the waveform, low frequency, high frequency, middle frequency, a 
combined graph and a spectograph. 


 Purpose:

The project allows us to utilize GUI to read file inputs and display graphs.
The project is inteded to address the problem of intelligibility in enclosed areas.
It also is an opportunity to understand how collaborations in the programming
industry can be and look like.

 Usage Instructions:

Run the program from the Run_Program_Here.py
Use the audio file from the folder or any 
.wav, .mp4, or .acc file to be analyzed.
