Python Final Project 15
Made by Emily Moran and Marilyn Pamias

# Overview:

    This projects goal is to create a virtual environment that allows for the
    analysis and graphing of a sound that is input into the program. The
    program should be user friendly meaing that with the use of a GUI there
    will be a load input button for the sound file. After the input is aquired
    the program will display a total of 6 graphs that show the waveform, low
    frequency, high frequency, middle frequency, a combined graph and a
    spectograph.

## Purpose:

    The project allows us to utilize GUI to read file inputs and display graphs.
    It also was an opportunity to understand how collaborations in the programming
    industry can be and look like.

## Usage Instructions:

    Run the program from the Run_Program_Here.py
    Use the audio file from the folder or any 
    .wav, .mp4, or .acc
