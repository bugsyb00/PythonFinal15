Version 2
4/19/2024

Created:

   inpButton: GUI used for the input button of the audio file
                -getFile()
                -combGraphs()
                -showStats()

Updated:

   CHANGE_LOG: added updates and creations from session 2

#
Version 3
4/20/2024

Created:

   graph.py: these are the tools that are needed to create/display
   wavtools.py: these are the checks made to identify the parts of
                 the wav sound file needed for the graphs and the make
                 graph function

Updated:

   inpButton: This file became the place to combine the pther two files

   inpButton ----> Run_Program_Here
                        file name changed. originally it was named impButton
                        because I intended to just use to for the gui display
                        but then it turned into the main combination of files
                        so the name change seemed appropriate.

Problem Encountered:

   Run_Program_Here: The error comes from there being an issue with connecting
                the wavtools and graph files to the inpButton. I found
                that if i do not import each function from the files
                individually, I get an error that I do not know how to
                fix.

#
Version 4
4/22/24

Updated:

   graph.py: went back through and made my graph colors pink and purple
              instead of the blues i chose originally

Idea:

   I am trying to find a way to make my graphs display in a tab on the
    page next to the file input button, combine graphs, and display button

#
Version 5
4/24/24

Updated:

  graphs.py: added the frequency diagram display and volume display
  Run_Program_Here.py: adds the frequency and volume diagrams and display graohs button
  Installed gitlog?? I thought I had it activated already for this project...

#
Version 6
4/26/24

Updated:
    converted the graphs and wavtools into two text files
    wavtools becomes audioCalculations
    graphs becomes display Plots
    Took the seperate code from the files and cobined it all into the main program file, this fixed my issue with the imported files not linking together properly
    Was able to get the buttons to display the plots in their own seperate tkinter windows
